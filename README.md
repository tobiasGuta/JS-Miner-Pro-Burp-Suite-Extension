**JS Miner Pro** is a lightweight, customizable Burp Suite extension designed to find hard-coded secrets, API endpoints, and hidden paths inside JavaScript, JSON, and HTML files.

Built using the modern **Montoya API**, it is optimized for Bug Hunters who need to dig deep into client-side code without the performance overhead of heavy scanners.

Why Use This?
-------------

Most passive scanners rely on Burp's default scanning scheduler, which often skips static files (`.js`, `.json`) to save performance during live audits.

**JS Miner Pro is different.** It implements the `HttpHandler` interface, meaning it sits directly in the HTTP traffic pipeline. It sees **every** response passing through the Proxy, Repeater, and Logger, ensuring no file is ignored even if it's cached or minified.

### Key Features

-   **Deep Traffic Inspection**: Scans all traffic (JS, HTML, JSON) for sensitive data.

-   **Fully Configurable Regex**: Add, edit, disable, or delete scanning rules on the fly.

-   **Persistent Settings**: Your custom regex rules are saved automatically and persist across restarts.

-   **Zero-Latency**: Optimized to ignore heavy media files (images, fonts) to keep your proxy fast.

-   **Smart UI**: Split-view interface with auto-highlighting. Click a finding to see exactly where it is in the response.

-   **Noise Filtering**: Built-in logic to ignore common false positives (like short paths).

Installation
------------

1.  Download the latest JAR file from the [Releases](https://github.com/tobiasGuta/JS-Miner-Pro-Burp-Suite-Extension/releases/download/JsMinerPro-2.0-Pro-all1212025/JsMinerPro-2.0-Pro-all.jar) page.

2.  Open **Burp Suite**.

3.  Navigate to **Extensions** -> **Installed**.

4.  Click **Add**.

5.  Select **Java** as the extension type.

6.  Select the `JsMinerPro-2.0-Pro-all.jar` file.

Building from Source
--------------------

If you want to modify the code or build it yourself, follow these steps. You need **Java 21** installed.

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tobiasGuta/JS-Miner-Pro-Burp-Suite-Extension.git
    cd js-miner-pro

    ```

2.  Build the "Fat JAR" (includes dependencies) using Gradle:

    -   **Linux/Mac**:

        ```
        ./gradlew shadowJar

        ```

    -   **Windows**:

        ```
        .\gradlew.bat shadowJar

        ```

3.  The compiled extension will be located in: `build/libs/JsMinerPro-2.0-Pro-all.jar`

Usage
-----

### 1\. The Results Tab

As you browse a target website, the extension passively scans responses. Findings appear in the **JS Miner -> Results** tab.

-   **Top Pane**: List of all found paths and secrets.

-   **Bottom Pane**: The Request/Response editor.

-   **Highlighting**: Click any row in the table, and the extension will automatically load the response and **highlight** the specific string found.

### 2\. The Configuration Tab

You can customize exactly what the extension looks for.

-   **Add Rule**: Create a new Regex pattern.

-   **Type**: Label it as a `PATH` or a `SECRET`.

-   **Active**: Toggle rules on/off without deleting them.

-   **Reset to Defaults**: If you mess up your rules, click this to restore the optimized default patterns.

### Default Regex Patterns

The extension comes pre-loaded with these battle-tested patterns:

| Rule Name        | Regex                                   | Description        |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Relative Paths   | `(?:\"` or `'`                            | —                  |
| Generic Secrets  | `(?i)((?:api_?key|access_?token)`         | —                  |
